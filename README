The ultimate goal of this project is to make easy to develop a
codegenaration backend in Python for arbitrary CPU, which takes LLVM IR
as input.

However, the code is currently very far away from that aim, and just
contains some hacks towards:

1. Graph-based register allocation.
2. Parsing LLVM IR into Python-native objects, with output support,
aiming towards 100% roundrip.
3. Utilities to transform LLVM encoded as Python objects, for example,
converting out of SSA form.

None of these separate features are complete though, so it may be useful:

1. As a starting base if you wanted to do something similar (I wish I
didn't have start from scratch myself).
2. As an example for llvmpy (http://llvmpy.org) usage.
