The ultimate goal of this project is to make easy to develop a
code genaration backend in Python for an arbitrary CPU, taking LLVM IR
as input.

However, the code is currently very far away from that aim, and just
contains some hacks towards:

1. Graph-based register allocation.
2. Parsing LLVM IR into Python-native objects, with output support,
aiming towards 100% roundtrip.
3. Utilities to transform LLVM encoded as Python objects, for example,
converting out of SSA form.

These separate features are not 100% complete either, so it may be useful:

1. As a starting base if you wanted to do something similar (I wish I
didn't have start from scratch myself).
2. As an example for llvmpy (http://llvmpy.org) usage.
